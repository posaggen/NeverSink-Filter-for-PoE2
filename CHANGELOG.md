----------------------------------
# **VERSION 0.5.0** - Initial Public Version
----------------------------------

Keep in mind this is just the initial release. The filter will be updated and improved over the days, weeks and hopefully years to come.

## SHORT OVERVIEW:

- The filter comes with a companion website: [FilterBlade.xyz](https://filterblade.xyz). FilterBlade allows modifying, previewing and customizing the filter to your needs and to your specific build. It's also a great way to learn what the filter can do and it's many features/colors.
- 7 levels of strictness ranging from soft to uber-plus-strict (semi-strict is recommended for beginners). These define the number of items hidden. A higher strictness filter shows fewer items. Very Strict or above should not be used while leveling, unless you're twinked out in leveling gear.
- Item colors, map icons and beams are clustered in a way to make item recognition really easy and minimize the cognitive efforts required to make good decisions. Plus due to the reuse of similar patterns it's good for your dopamin-on-drop-maxing.
- added first alternative style: Dark Mode
- the filter is written using a dedicated programming domain language to minimize errors, optimize performance, increase quality and make its management easier. This concept has been proven quite effective in the many years that I've been supporting PoE1.
- added the following economy based tierlists: currencies, runes, soul cores, catalysts, distilled emotions, essences, omen, fragments/tablets and others. Most bases come with 6 tiers (S,A,B,C,D,E) that are economically tiered and easily distinguishable
- uniques have their own tierlist, that is slightly different and has support for boss-drops and uniques with multiple bases. NOTE: in POE(2) you can't distinguish an specific unique on the same base. For instance the filter can't tell if a unique 'silk robe' is a 'cloak of flame' or a 'temporalis'.
- added neutral-basetype-tiering: a comprehensive tiering of every single basetype from the endgame's player perspective. In the future FilterBlade will provide the choice of the neutral and the meta-based basetype tiering. You'll also be able to mix and match those
- added rare and normal/magic crafting progression: the filter now scales the basetypes available depending on the map tier. For instance: in a level 68 zone a 'advanced dualstring bow' is still one of the best bases. However, in a level 80 zone it is quite poor, since new bases get unlocked
- added special highlight and treatment for bases in arealevel 82
- added campaign leveling mode. The shift between leveling and endgame happens at arealevel 65. Campaign and endgame is handled by the same filter.
- every single item type in the game is tiered or otherwise handled. If it's NOT known, the filter will notify you with a special PINK/CYAN color. If you see this color, you most likely should update the filter.
