## **QUICK START:**

This is an "ItemFilter" - a script for the game Path of Exile 2 (not PoE1!). It highlights valuable items, and enhances gameplay comfort and experience.
This is _NOT_ a hack/mod. It written using the official POE filter domain language.

This is my full filter for PoE2 and a successor to my initial lite-filter.

Feature highlights

- The filter comes with a companion website: [FilterBlade.xyz](https://filterblade.xyz). FilterBlade allows modifying, previewing and customizing the filter to your needs and to your specific build. It's also a great way to learn what the filter can do and its many features/colors.
- 7 levels of strictness ranging from soft to uber-plus-strict (semi-strict is recommended for beginners). These define the number of items hidden. A higher strictness filter shows fewer items. Very Strict or above should not be used while leveling, unless you're twinked out in leveling gear.
- Item colors, map icons and beams are clustered in a way to make item recognition really easy and minimize the cognitive efforts required to make good decisions. Plus due to the reuse of similar patterns it's good for your dopamin-on-drop-maxing.
- added first alternative style: Dark Mode
- the filter is written using a dedicated programming domain language to minimize errors, optimize performance, increase quality and make its management easier. This concept has been proven quite effective in the many years that I've been supporting PoE1.
- added the following economy based tierlists: currencies, runes, soul cores, catalysts, distilled emotions, essences, omen, fragments/tablets and others. Most bases come with 6 tiers (S,A,B,C,D,E) that are economically tiered and easily distinguishable
- uniques have their own tierlist, that is slightly different and has support for boss-drops and uniques with multiple bases. NOTE: in POE(2) you can't distinguish an specific unique on the same base. For instance the filter can't tell if a unique 'silk robe' is a 'cloak of flame' or a 'temporalis'.
- added neutral-basetype-tiering: a comprehensive tiering of every single basetype from the endgame's player perspective. In the future FilterBlade will provide the choice of the neutral and the meta-based basetype tiering. You'll also be able to mix and match those
- added rare and normal/magic crafting progression: the filter now scales the basetypes available depending on the map tier. For instance: in a level 68 zone a 'advanced dualstring bow' is still one of the best bases. However, in a level 80 zone it is quite poor, since new bases get unlocked
- added special highlight and treatment for bases in arealevel 82
- added campaign leveling mode. The shift between leveling and endgame happens at arealevel 65. Campaign and endgame is handled by the same filter.
- every single item type in the game is tiered or otherwise handled. If it's NOT known, the filter will notify you with a special PINK/CYAN color. If you see this color, you most likely should update the filter.

## **IMPORTANT: MUST READ:**

1. The filters in this GitHub project are ALWAYS updated before the start of a new league (4-6 hours before start). Afterwards, usually every few weeks.
2. The filters from this GitHub project do NOT auto-update. At least redownload the latest version once a league - better once a month - to stay up-to-date and not miss out on valuable drops! There is an auto-updater, read about it below.
3. Filters can't distinguish between different variations of one unique base! A unique "Leather Belt" can be an expensive "Headhunter" or a cheap "Wurm's Molt". The same goes for all unique jewels etc. Things that need manual checking usually have a blue icon on the minimap!

## **HOW TO INSTALL?**

Currently there are multiple sources:

Download the latest release from github.

- [FILTER LADDER](https://www.pathofexile.com/account/view-profile/NeverSink-3349/item-filters) - Are you new to the game and don't care about styles and finetuning the filter to your gameplay experience? I recommend subscribing to my filters on the ladder. It's just a click, fast and auto-updates. Just restart the game and select the subscribed filter in the options menu. The downside is that you can't edit these filters or use styles. Once you're more experienced consider:
- *[FILTERBLADE](https://www.filterblade.xyz)* - you can adjust the filter to your preferences here, change the appearance, style and finetune everything to your liking.
    - We also offer a [FilterBlade Auto-Updater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8RJx0s0zsA), it's super comfy and you don't have to install anything, but heavy on our servers, so it costs a few bucks. Plus you support the project.
- You can also download the [LATEST RELEASE](https://github.com/NeverSinkDev/NeverSink-PoE2litefilter/releases/latest) from github. Note that it doesn't auto-update though and unlike my filterblade/ladder is not adjusted to match the economy perfectly. 

0. Get the latest filter file from [GitHub](https://github.com/NeverSinkDev/NeverSink-PoE2litefilter/releases/latest).
1. Extract the files using 7zip or a similar tool.
2. Paste the `NeverSinks Litefilter.filter` file into the following folder (directly where ingame folder button opens - not a subfolder):
   - NOTE: do NOT place it in the 'onlinefilters' folder in the directories below!
   - Windows: `%userprofile%\Documents\My Games\Path of Exile 2`
   - Linux: `steamapps/compatdata/2694490/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/My Documents/My Games/Path of Exile 2`
4. INGAME: Escape -> Options -> Game -> Filters -> Select the filter from the dropdown box.
5. Done. Enjoy.
